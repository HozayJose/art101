//I absolutely despise myself for various reasons, and one of them right now is not realizing just how much of an idiot I was for blindly following other's advice expecting them to give me answers to my concerns instead of me taking a step back to see the problems I was causing. It's nice that I was able to indentify something critical in my flaws but to know and visibly see how much it affected someone I care about just hurts so much it makes me feel like I shouldn't have been part of their life to begin with from having caused them so much suffering. It's such an immense guilt and it makes me feel like I was a monster unaware of what I was doing, and what made it even worse was how the story unwraveled from my twitsed words which ended up giving the wrong idea and my close friends supported me fully, beleiving what I said without questioning me. I didn't even question myself if what I was doing was right or not thinking nothing was my fault yet at the same time having a strange sinking feeling that something was wrong. It took me over a year to finally see that and it's a pain worse than my lung surgery or the multiple needles of anastesia that were given to me the 4 times my nail was removed. This emotional pain is almost like I'm choking myself without realizing it, and it's so much worse than any physical pain I've felt before. I'm seeking professional help but at the same time it's as if I'm digging in the wrong places and I'm being supported only in areas that can easily be fixed. I'm sorry for the rant, I just had to get some of it out..wihtout my partner seeing it or he'd just be worried since I wasn't intentionally harming him, but my guilt will make him feel bad and I don't feel like I deserve even a drop of pity for how much damage I caused. It's not bad like "I wanna kill myself" bad, but it's just a horrible feeling and the main thing keeping me afloat right now from completely going apeshit and causing a commotion is my logic. //
