        <h2> Challenge </h2>
        <p> It was a challenge to remember how jQuery works
          even after the lecture, but we went back to the
          slides and looked at a few guides about jQery to iron in the basics. </p>

      <div id="problems">
        <h2> Problems </h2>
        <p> we had a problem with interpreting task 2,
          specifically the promt: "Toggle a class special within
          the div of the section". We think it means to create a
          class called special in the Challenge, Problems, and
          Results divs, and we hope we didn't misinterpret the prompt. </p>

      <div id="results">
        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> The results are found when you click on the buttons. Neat, huh? </p>
